        <p> This past couple of weeks have been a little crazy caused by Covid-19. We have been quartined which mean we can't go any where if it is not necessary. But a couple weeks after they called shelter in place which is stricter and if you go some where not necessary we can get a ticket or a fine. Me and my family some times go on bike rides, read, do our schoolwork,go to the park, or geocash. Almost ever time we go to the grocery store people buy al the toilet paper and canned goods. There is litterly no food because people have gone crazy and bought everthing in the stores. Not everybody went crazy so the people who didn't don't have very much food. <br>

        Today it is Saturday so my dad is of work even though there is Covid-19(the corona virus). We work on setting up the living room for the grand piono that we are getting soon. me and my sister were going to spend the night at our friend the Cope's house because it was Emma Kates birthday but since they have called the shelter in place it was considered illegel to go so we couldn't go. We were going to plant a garden but it rained and made it rerally muddy. Ever Monday we go up to the elementery school or RREto get school work for the week and a free lunch. Overall, I have learn that you need to wash your hands and KNOW GOD IS IN CONTROL. God always has a good reson for everything.
