        <p> This past couple of weeks have been a little crazy caused by Covid-19. We have been quartined which mean we can't go any where if it is not necessary. But a couple weeks after they called shelter in place which is stricter and if you go some where not necessary we can get a ticket or a fine. Me and my family some times go on bike rides, read, do our schoolwork,go to the park, or geocash. Almost ever time we go to the grocery store people buy al the toilet paper and canned goods. There is litterly no food because people have gone crazy and bought everthing in the stores. Not everybody went crazy so the people who didn't don't have very much food. :) <br>

        Today it is Saturday so my dad is of work even though there is Covid-19(the corona virus). We work on setting up the living room for the grand piono that we are getting soon. me and my sister were going to spend the night at our friend the Cope's house because it was Emma Kates birthday but since they have called the shelter in place it was considered illegel to go so we couldn't go. We were going to plant a garden but it rained and made it rerally muddy. Ever Monday we go up to the elementery school or RREto get school work for the week and a free lunch. Overall, I have learn that you need to wash your hands and KNOW GOD IS IN CONTROL. God always has a good reson for everything. :)

        Today when I woke up my parents were outside working. When my mom came in I ate breakfast and stated to clean up my room. Before lunch me my brother and sister and my mom took the dog on a walk up and down our drive way for our bible stidy for the day. After I ate lunch I started making two loaves of bread so we don't have to buy any for the next couple of days. Since it is Sunday my dad likes to work really hard to get thing done that is is needed so he was outside almost the whole day.At the end of the day aroun 5:00 I did my chores which is feeding the chickens, collecting the eggs, and feeding the cow which is really skinny so we are fattening her and her baby up. We haven't been able to go outside much because it has been raining. It sounds like it is going to rain tonight but lets hope it doesn't. Like I have been saying God does this for a good reason.:)

        Today I ate breakfast and listened to my bible study on the couch and then went on my walk. We usally listen to bible study on our walk but today I didn't. Since we didn't listen to the bible study on the walk I ran with my dog Razzberry. It was fun but I got pretty tied really quick because we sprinted the whole time. After that We went to the school to pick up our home work for a couple weeks since we don't have any school after we got back I ate lunch which we got at the school were we pick up our school work because they give out free lunches. After eating I did my home work and checked with my friend Jamie. When we finish talking my mom said me and my sister can watch TV. When my dad got home we ate dinner and made brownies. Tonight we are probly going to watch TV. I hope I've inspired other to write blogs too.

We had no idea how to do it so we justed winged it. We finally figured it out after about an hour. We went on a bike ride  and had a nerf gun fight. My mom went grocery shopping so when the house was free me and my siblings made the house a mess with obsticles to hide behind. When my dad got home from workwe got ever thing ready for the goats for the night. Tonight we are going to watch TV. :)

        Today when my mom woke me up I did my chores which is feeding our new goats and the mama cow that is really skinny do to feeding her calf. After that I ate breakfast and listen to our bible study as usally. After that I went on a walk with my family an our dogs. After eating lunch and playing other things my mom said we have to many eggs that I don't think they are good any more so she said we could chunk them in the back. When we got to the back we started to though them at a tree and then started playing baseball with them and a stick. When we hit the eggs with a stick it got all over us. My sister Ally got covered in eggs. Since  she was wearing a cat shirt she said the cat got sick and threw up but my mom wasn't buying it. Today was so much fun and I hope you have fun too. :)

        Today I woke up and did my chores, ate breakfast, did my bible study, and went on my walk. After that it was almost time to eat lunch. After eating lunch Me and my family wanted to play a game so we ended up playing ticket to ride. The piont of the game is to play the longest train and finish the most tickets to win. I ended up not winning but over all it was really fun to send time with my family. Before we finish playing we saw a pretty white-cream colored cat with blue eyes outside and wanted to see if it  was friendly so we went to go see it. It ended up being nice to us but not nice to our other 4 cats so we had to chase it away. When I did my chores during the evening my dad came home early so it was excited after that we just sat down an watched tv. :)

When she was gone me and Will fed the goats, ate breakfast, and did our kitchen chores. After only after a couple hour my mom was back and she made us lunch. Lunch was hot dogs, apples, and chips. Durring luch we did our bible study. When we were finished with lunch we started making buffalo chip cookies. Before we finished my mom had to go to the vet to see why our goat is sick. Me and Will finished the cookies and we helped my mom give it meds. We had to treat all of them becauce it was just bad bacteria in it's guts. After we got all the cookies out of the oven ME, Ally, and my mom all watched a movie while Will read a book. We fed the goats and ate dinner and are probly going to watch night at the museum. :)
