        <p> This past couple of weeks have been a little crazy caused by Covid-19. We have been quartined which mean we can't go any where if it is not necessary. But a couple weeks after they called shelter in place which is stricter and if you go some where not necessary we can get a ticket or a fine. Me and my family some times go on bike rides, read, do our schoolwork,go to the park, or geocash. Almost ever time we go to the grocery store people buy al the toilet paper and canned goods. There is litterly no food because people have gone crazy and bought everthing in the stores. Not everybody went crazy so the people who didn't don't have very much food. <br>

        Today it is Saturday so my dad is of work even though there is Covid-19(the corona virus). We work on setting up the living room for the grand piono that we are getting soon. me and my sister were going to spend the night at our friend the Cope's house because it was Emma Kates birthday but since they have called the shelter in place it was considered illegel to go so we couldn't go. We were going to plant a garden but it rained and made it rerally muddy. Ever Monday we go up to the elementery school or RREto get school work for the week and a free lunch. Overall, I have learn that you need to wash your hands and KNOW GOD IS IN CONTROL. God always has a good reson for everything.

        Today when I woke up my parents were outside working. When my mom came in I ate breakfast and stated to clean up my room. Before lunch me my brother and sister and my mom took the dog on a walk up and down our drive way for our bible stidy for the day. After I ate lunch I started making two loaves of bread so we don't have to buy any for the next couple of days. Since it is Sunday my dad likes to work really hard to get thing done that is is needed so he was outside almost the whole day.At the end of the day aroun 5:00 I did my chores which is feeding the chickens, collecting the eggs, and feeding the cow which is really skinny so we are fattening her and her baby up. We haven't been able to go outside much because it has been raining. It sounds like it is going to rain tonight but lets hope it doesn't. Like I have been saying God does this for a good reason.

        Today I ate breakfast and listened to my bible study on the couch and then went on my walk. We usally listen to bible study on our walk but today I didn't. Since we didn't listen to the bible study on the walk I ran with my dog Razzberry. It was fun but I got pretty tied really quick because we sprinted the whole time. After that We went to the school to pick up our home work for a couple weeks since we don't have any school after we got back I ate lunch which we got at the school were we pick up our school work because they give out free lunches. After eating I did my home work and checked with my friend Jamie. When we finish talking my mom said me and my sister can watch TV. When my dad got home we ate dinner and made brownies. Tonight we are probly going to watch TV. I hope I've inspired other to write blogs too. Here is the brownie recipe that we made earlier: <div><a href = "https://www.cookingclassy.com/brownie-recipe/">For Brownie Recipe Click Here</a></div>              <div align = "right">-Bryn </div>

        Today about 30 min. after I woke up we got delivered fainting goats. We got 2 does and 2 doeling. After we played and made them faint we ate lunch and changed our intertubes on our bikes. We had no idea how to do it so we justed winged it. We finally figured it out after about an hour. We went on a bike ride  and had a nerf gun fight. My mom went grocery shopping so when the house was free me and my siblings made the house a mess with obsticles to hide behind. When my dad got home from workwe got ever thing ready for the goats for the night. Tonight we are going to watch TV.
